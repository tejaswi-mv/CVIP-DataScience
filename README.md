HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL
üè° **House Price Prediction: A Summary** üìà

As part of my internship at CodersCave, I developed a model to predict house prices using machine learning. Here's a quick summary of the process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Exploration**: I analyzed a dataset containing information about various house features.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**: I cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed categorical features using one-hot encoding.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis**: I visualized correlations between features and analyzed the distribution of categorical variables.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning**: I removed irrelevant columns and filled in missing values.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training**: I split the data into training and validation sets, then trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the training data.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**: I used the trained model to make predictions on the validation set and evaluated its performance using mean absolute percentage error.

The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 18.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting house prices.

This project is an integral part of my internship experience at CodersCave, where I had the opportunity to apply my machine learning skills to real-world data analysis tasks.
